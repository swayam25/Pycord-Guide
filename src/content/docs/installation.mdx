Before you can start using Pycord, you need to install the library.

<Aside type="note">Python **3.9 or above** is required to use Pycord.</Aside>

<Aside type="tip">
    Before you start installing python packages globally, it's recommended you set up a virtual environment. You can find instructions for that
    [here](/more/virtual-environments/).
</Aside>

## Fresh Installation

To install Pycord, you can use the following command in your terminal:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Tabs>
    <TabItem label="pip">
        ```bash
        pip install py-cord
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="uv">
        ```bash
        uv add py-cord
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Aside type="tip">
    Remember that you need to install `py-cord`, not `pycord`. Also, the `pip` command varies depending on your installation. For example, it might be
    `python3 -m pip` on macOS/Linux or `py3 -m pip` on some versions of Windows.
</Aside>

If you need voice support for your bot, you should run:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Tabs>
    <TabItem label="pip">
        ```bash
        pip install "py-cord[voice]"
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="uv">
        ```bash
        uv add "py-cord[voice]"
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Migration

### Updating Pycord

If you are upgrading from a previous version of Pycord, you can use the following command in your terminal to upgrade to the latest version:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Tabs>
    <TabItem label="pip">
        ```bash
        pip install -U py-cord
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="uv">
        ```bash
        uv update py-cord
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Migrating from other libraries

If you are migrating from another library, say, `discord.py`, first of all, you need to uninstall it.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Tabs>
    <TabItem label="pip">
        ```bash
        pip uninstall discord.py
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="uv">
        ```bash
        uv remove discord.py
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>
Then, you can install Pycord, it's as simple as that!:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Tabs>
    <TabItem label="pip">
        ```bash
        pip install py-cord
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="uv">
        ```bash
        uv add py-cord
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Aside type="caution">Uninstalling `discord.py` *after* installing `py-cord` can cause issues. Make sure to uninstall it first!</Aside>

## Installing Other Builds

### Development Build

    The development build comes with cutting edge features and new functionality, but as it isn't a stable build you may encounter bugs.
</Aside>

To install the development build, you can use the following command in your terminal:
