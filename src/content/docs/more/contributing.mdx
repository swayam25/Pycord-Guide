## Contributing to the Guide

This guide is built with [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/) (powered by Astro). You can contribute by:

- Fixing typos or improving explanations
- Adding new examples or tutorials
- Updating outdated information
- Improving code samples

**Resources:**

- [Guide Repository](https://github.com/Pycord-Development/guide)
- [Guide Contributing Rules](https://github.com/Pycord-Development/guide/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
- [Starlight Documentation](https://starlight.astro.build/)

### Guide Structure and Setup

#### Info

We use [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/) (built on Astro) to generate our guide. All the guide pages are generated
from `mdx` files in the `src/content/docs/` directory.
MDX allows you to use JSX in your markdown content.

#### File Structure

Let's visit the `src/content/docs/` directory and check its file structure.

We can see various folders and a few files in it. Let's talk a bit about the `introduction.mdx` file. At the top, you can see something like:

```md
---
title: Introduction
description: ...
---
```

Most pages have this at the top. The `title` defaults to the file name. Since the titles need to be Capitalized according to need while the file names are lowercased (sometimes, the file names are shorter than the title!), we set a title ourselves.

The `description` field is also important. This is the text shown in an embed when the page's link is shared on Discord, Twitter or other websites that support embedded links. Make sure to give a nice an interesting description!

#### Markdown Syntax

This page quickly outlines some of the syntax that is used in markdown.

````mdx
Markdown syntax is pretty easy. You can add **bold**, _italic_ and _underline_ text. You can use ~~strikethrough~~. You can use `inline code blocks`.

    ```py
    print("We can use code blocks like this.")
    ```

You can add [links to other websites](https://pycord.dev). You can add images like this: ![alternate text that describes the image](https://pycord.dev/image.png).

- You can create
- unordered lists like this

1. Or ordered lists
2. Like this

3. If you want markdown to automatically detect what number you are on, you can use `1.`
4. Like this

# Headers

## Go

### Like

#### This

You can even use HTML in Markdown.

<samp>This text is monospaced</samp>
Use <br /> to add a break line.

> We can use blockquotes too.

2 ways to create tables:

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Header</th>
        <th>Header</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Cell</td>
        <td>Cell</td>
    </tr>
</table>

| Header | Header |
| ------ | ------ |
| Cell   | Cell   |

Here's a line for us to start with.

This line is separated from the one above by two new lines, so it will be a _separate paragraph_.

This line is also a separate paragraph, but...
This line is only separated by a single newline, so it's a separate line in the _same paragraph_.

We can use emojis too! :joy:

- [x] We can have task lists too
- [ ] This is a task
- [ ] That's not done yet
````

#### Asides (Admonitions)

We can add warnings, notes, etc. with the following syntax:

```mdx
<Aside type="note">Some **content** with _markdown_ `syntax`.</Aside>

<Aside type="tip">Some **content** with _markdown_ `syntax`.</Aside>

<Aside type="caution">Some **content** with _markdown_ `syntax`.</Aside>

<Aside type="danger">Some **content** with _markdown_ `syntax`.</Aside>

<Aside type="tip" title="Cool Stuff">
    You can edit an aside's title by adding a title attribute!
</Aside>
```

#### Discord Message Components

<Aside type="note" title="Import paths">
    We use Astro path aliases. Do not use deep relative paths for components, images, or payloads. The configured aliases are:
    <code>"$images/*": ["./src/images/*"]</code>,<code>"$components/*": ["./src/components/*"]</code>,<code>"$payloads/*": ["./src/payloads/*"]</code>
    .
</Aside>

Most files already have the import for the Discord component wrapper.

First, import the necessary component:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```mdx
import DiscordComponent from "$components/DiscordComponent.astro";
```

Under the hood, `DiscordComponent` uses the [Widgetbot message renderer](https://github.com/widgetbot-io/message-renderer/).
This means that it works by displaying actual Discord messages payloads.

<Steps>

    1. Create a Discord message payload.
       Add one or more message payloads in the `src/payloads/` directory. Choose or create an appropriate subdirectory and file name depending on what part of the guide you are working on.

    2. Import the message payload in the page you want to display it in, like so:
       ```mdx
        import DorukyumHelloPayload from "$payloads/more/contributing/dorukyum-hello-user-msg.json";
       ```

    3. Use the `DiscordComponent` component to render the message(s):
       ```mdx
        <DiscordComponent messages={[DorukyumHelloPayload]} />
       ```
       The `messages` prop takes either an array of message payloads or an array of arrays of message payloads to display in groups.

</Steps>

This is what the above example message would look like:

<DiscordComponent messages={[PaillatExamplePayload]} />

Here is a simple message command to easily obtain a message payload from Discord:

````py
import json
import discord
import os

bot = discord.Bot()

@bot.message_command(name="Get msg payload", contexts={discord.InteractionContextType.guild, discord.InteractionContextType.bot_dm, discord.InteractionContextType.private_channel}, integration_types={discord.IntegrationType.user_install, discord.IntegrationType.guild_install})
async def msg_payload(ctx: discord.ApplicationContext, message: discord.Message):
    await ctx.respond(f"Message payload: ```\n{json.dumps(message._raw_data)}\n```", ephemeral=True)

bot.run(os.getenv("DISCORD_TOKEN"))
````

## Page Format

There are a few things you need to take care of:

1. Make sure that the spelling and grammar is perfect. We have a GitHub action configured that will warn you about spelling errors when you start a pull request. Make sure to commit your changes accordingly.

    As for the grammar, you should try reading the changes you have done and wait for reviews from others.

2. A common mistake people make is incorrect header style. People often think that the less the important the topic is, the lower it's heading style should be.

    ```md
    [PAGE STARTS]

    # Topic

    ## Less Important Topic

    ## Subtopic
    ```

    ```md
    [PAGE STARTS]

    # About

    [Introduction]

    ## Installation

    [Content]

    ### Windows

    [Content]
    ```

    That's VERY wrong. Here's the correct example:

    ```md
    [PAGE STARTS]
    [Introduction]

    ## Topic

    ## Less Important Topic

    ### Subtopic
    ```

    ```md
    [PAGE STARTS]
    [Introduction]

    ## About

    [More Information]

    ## Installation

    [Content]

    ### Windows

    [Content]
    ```

    Note that the `---`s at the beginning have been skipped here.
